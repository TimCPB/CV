Driven, enthusiastic and empathetic full-stack developer. A fast learner with experience in Ruby and JavaScript, Iâ€™ve recently graduated from Makers Academy. After several years building a career around my love of cycling, I relished the fresh challenge of Makers and am excited to build a new life as a developer.

### Skills

#### Drive and follow through - Project management??

Over consecutive years I took the concept of a "Cycling Demo Day" on Box Hill from a small gathering of regular customers and one or two niche brands to a large event attracting global brands like BMC, Look, Cervelo and Assos. It became a cornerstone of our sales projections for the year and companies like Canyon even reached out for advice on running their own, similar events.

#### Leadership

Working with a small core team and a wider cast of part-time staff means that clear and open communication is vital. At Maison Du Velo we didn't necessarily have the number of people necessary to have specialised roles for things like event management, online sales and social media communications so I instituted and lead short daily task settings and weekly 'lessons leanrt' meetings. This helped us to priroitise, kept everyone accountable, made efficient use of our time and ensured that no customers or projects were neglected.

I found this experience transferred very well into the Agile processes we used during our project work at Makers. By the halfway mark of our final, two week project it had become clear to me that our team had lost our way and were not on track to deliver a product matching the brief we had set ourselves. I organised an d led an emergency meeting and planning session during which we talked honestly, without blame, about where we had gone wrong. We agreed to streamline our product and broke it down into small, achievable goals, arranged into two, two day sprints. We met our brief and delivered a product we were all proud of.

#### Communication

Building customer base with weekly rides. Interviews in cycling press - quoted as ask the expert

Project work - create open, honest environment and to knowledge share


#### Collaboration / Team Work

MDV - collaborating with designers, reps and distributors to problem solve and arrange mutually beneficial buying agreements

Makers - projects - swapping roles, etc etc

#### Extras to mention

- Organising trips!
- Overhaul of sales strategy
